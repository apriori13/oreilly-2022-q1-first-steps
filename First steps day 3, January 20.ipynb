    "1. Data structures!\n",

    "    - Numbers (integers and floats)\n",
    "2. Sequences \n",
    "    - Strings: immutable (cannot be changed), contain characters\n",
    "        - anything textual -- user input, displaying on the screen, reading from files, reading from the network, sending e-mail\n",
    "        - `str.strip` -- removes whitespace from the sides\n",
    "        - `str.isdigit` -- tells us if there are only digits in the string\n",
    "        - `str.lower` -- returns a new string, based on ours, in lowercase\n",
    "    - Lists: mutable (can be changed), contain anything\n",
    "        - collections of data (traditionally of the same type) -- lists of users, lists of filenames, lists of folders, lists of IP addresses\n",
    "        - `list.append` -- adds an element to the end of the list\n",
    "        - `list.pop` -- removes the element from the end of a list\n",
    "    - Tuples: immutable (cannot be changed), contain anything\n",
    "        - collections of *differently*-typed data -- records or structs\n",
    "    - All sequences can do:\n",
    "        - Retrieve with `[i]`, where `i` is a numeric index\n",
    "        - Get the length with `len(s)`, where `s` is a sequence\n",
    "        - Retrieve a slice with `[start:stop]`\n",
    "        - Search with `in`\n",
    "        - Loop with `for`\n",
    "3. Loops\n",
    "    - `for` loops -- iterate over every element of a sequence\n",
    "    - `for` loops on `range(n)` gives us `n` items, from 0 to `n`-1\n",
    "    - `while` loops, which run so long as the condition is `True`\n",
    "4. Strings to lists and back       \n",
    "    - `str.split` -- returns a list of strings, based on the string\n",
    "    - `str.join` -- returns a string, based on a \"glue\" string and a list of strings"
